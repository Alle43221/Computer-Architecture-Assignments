# Computer Architecture - Assembly Language Assignments

This repository contains my assignments for the **Computer Architecture** course, with a focus on programming in **Assembly language**. These projects aim to deepen understanding of low-level programming, CPU architecture, and the inner workings of computer systems, from basic operations to advanced algorithms and system calls.

## Key Topics

- **Assembly Language Fundamentals**: Instruction set, registers, memory addressing, and program structure.
- **Arithmetic and Logic Operations**: Low-level implementation of basic and complex arithmetic functions.
- **Control Flow**: Branching, looping, and procedural programming in Assembly.
- **Data Structures in Assembly**: Implementing arrays and strings at the assembly level.
- **System Calls and OS Interaction**: Handling I/O operations directly.

## Requirements

- **Assembly Language Simulator**:  NASM for x86.
- **Text Editor/IDE**: Any Assembly-compatible editor or IDE.
